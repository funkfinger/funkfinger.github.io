I'm going to try and use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for this site going forward. While very minimal, I'm tired of maintence that I have hosting a Wordpress site. I will attempt to import the old posts (hopefully with comments) from Wordpress into this blog or archive them somewhere else. It's not like there's a ton of content up there either, so whatever. Oh, and no one reads or really even knows about this blog anyway so what the hay...
